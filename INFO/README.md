SOLIS is a world where animals live and evolve without human interference,
They eat, kill and have babies all in a program.
Every being in SOLIS is AI and evolves,
It learns from in mistakes and passes on it's genes.
Neural Networks are what make this possible.
The engine that makes this possible is Unreal Engine.
